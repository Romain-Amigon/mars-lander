# mars-lander (In progress, pause )

Genetic algorithm

graphic interface and simulator made by Jamesscn (https://github.com/Jamesscn/Mars-Lander.git) (maps are in his project), I improved it with a save of results, a final graph and loops for mutation.

The code is not finished !

It converges for map_a1, map_b1, map_b2 and map_b3, for the moment it only efficient for the horizontal axe (not the vertical, none the rotation or speed).

It's on pause due to the fall Challenge.
